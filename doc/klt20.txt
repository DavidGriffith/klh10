	Once you have installed the KLH10 binaries, you will need to
install a PDP-10 operating system on the KN10's virtual disks.  This
file documents the basic procedure for TOPS-20 on a KL10B.

The TOPS-20 installation procedures are described in a Digital
document titled "TOPS-20 KL Model B Installation Guide", available
online as a file called "install.mem" from some sites.  Some of the
steps on a KN10 (aside from the obvious lack of hardware) may be
different, however.

You will need an "installation" tape or tape image to get started, and
almost certainly will want to install the accompanying sources and
tools.  You should already have a valid TOPS-20 license (personal or
otherwise) in order to use them.

These are the tapes containing the last known DEC TOPS-20 distribution
for the KL10B (DEC-2065), which was TOPS-20 V7.0:

	BB-H137F-BM     TOPS-20 V7.0 INSTL 16MT9
	BB-EV83B-BM     TCP/IP-20 V4.0 DISTR 16MT9
	BB-H138F-BM     T20 V7.0 DIST 16MT9 TAPE 1OF2
	BB-LW55A-BM     T20 V7.0 DIST 16MT9 TAPE 2OF2
	BB-M780D-SM     TOPS-20 V7.0 MONITOR SRC 16MT
	BB-GS97B-SM     TOPS-20 EXEC SRC 16MT9
	BB-M080Z-SM     T20 V7.0 #04 MON SRC MOD 16MT
	BB-M081Z-SM     T20 V7.0 #04 EXEC SRC MOD 16M
	BB-PENEA-BM     TOPS-20 V7.0 TSU04 TP 1 OF 2
	BB-KL11M-BM     TOPS-20 V7.0 TSU04 TP 2 OF 2
	BB-M836D-BM     TOPS-20 V7.0 TOOLS 16MT9

It should be possible to obtain these from www.trailing-edge.com.  In
particular, start with the first of these, which is the installation
tape:
	ftp://ftp.trailing-edge.com/pub/pdp10/bb-h137f-bm.tap.gz

The script that follows assumes you have uncompressed this into
"bb-h137f-bm.tap" in your $KLH10_HOME.

NOTE: the installation tape does not contain a TCP/IP monitor
image.  Before you can use the network, you will need to also restore
the files from the tape "BB-EV83B-BM TCP/IP-20 V4.0 DISTR 16MT9"
(there was more than one version; only the latest has monitor
images).

In the transcript that follows, all notes are prefaced by triple
semicolons (;;;), and user input is presented in lowercase where
possible -- note that the monitor sometimes echoes typein in
uppercase.  Where there might be some confusion, a note such as "Type
CR" will identify what you need to type.

There are large manuals devoted to TOPS-20 system maintenance, but
this is enough to make you dangerous.

TOPS-20 TCP/IP INSTALLATION
===========================

	This aspect is probably the one that many KLH10 users will be
most interested in.  Unfortunately I ran out of time to provide a full
script, but this should be enough to get you going:

(1) Install all of the V7 install tape (as above)

(2) Restore all files from the following tape:

	BB-EV83B-BM     TCP/IP-20 V4.0 DISTR 16MT9

    This one is a pain, because the DLUSER.DAT on the install tape doesn't
    set up the necessary directories beforehand, so you will have to create
    them all by hand (make sure they are files-only!).

(3) Assign a valid IP address for your system, if you don't already have
    one.  This should be something consistent with your physical subnet.

(4) Create the file <SYSTEM>INTERNET.ADDRESS with either an editor or
    a COPY from the TTY:, in the following format (replacing the
    "192 168 0 201" with your desired IP address):

$vd internET.*.* 

   PS:<SYSTEM>
 INTERNET.ADDRESS.1;P777752   1 57(7)     5-Oct-2001 22:06:55 OPERATOR  
$ty internET.ADDRESS.1 
IPNI#0,192 168 0 201,PACKET-SIZE:1500,DEFAULT,PREFERRED
$
    Keep the packet size at 1500.  I found it set to 1504 once and
    that was breaking things.


(4) Now reboot, with this devdefine added to your KLH10 config file:

        devdef ni0 564 ni20 ipaddr=192.168.0.201

    (Again, use your correct IP address here)


(5) Manually specify this to the BOOT> prompt:

        <NEW-SYSTEM>AN-MONMAX

    Or you can just copy or rename that file to <SYSTEM>MONITR.EXE to
    make it the default. 

(6) After system comes up, telnet in from ANOTHER machine.  Depending on
    your platform it's unlikely you will be able to telnet in from the
    same host that the emulator is running on, unless you are using
    a separate dedicated interface.

    If this succeeds, take a break and have a <favorite beverage here>. 

(7) About now you will start to get really annoyed by periodic bleats that
    look like this:

SJ  0:  [SCHEDULER]:        Waiting for UPS:
SJ  0: **** OPR(3) 22:18:48 ****
SJ  0: **** MAILS(4) 22:19:48 ****

    This can be permanently turned off by removing its invocation from
    the 7-PTYCON.ATO startup file, but a good temporary fix is simply
    to kill the offending job.

    Do a SYS to find the job called MX, then forcibly log it out:

$sys
 Fri 5-Oct-2001 23:05:45  Up 0:53:26
 0+8 Jobs   Load av   0.03   0.03   0.03

 Job  Line Program  User              Origin

   3   210  EXEC    OPERATOR
   4   211  EXEC    OPERATOR

TOPS-20 TCP/IP - OTHER NOTES
============================

These are miscellaneous notes from my files.  I have not verified
whether they apply to the vanilla DEC TCP/IP system.


SYSTEM:KNILDR.EXE -- utility that can be used to restart the NI20.
    The useful commands are "HALT 0" and "START 0" which will stop and
    start the KLNI in case something went wrong during startup (timing
    races) or the KLH10 DPNI20 subprocess needs to be replaced with a new
    version without bringing the system down.  Run this from the console,
    or you'll saw off the branch you're sitting on.


---- SYSTEM:INTERNET.ADDRESS -----
---- Read on system startup; no provision I can see for re-reading any
        other time.

        ;;;Internet addresses for system
        IPNI#0, 16 151 16 13,DEFAULT,PREFERRED,PACKET-SIZE:1504

---- SYSTEM:INTERNET.GATEWAYS -----
---- Read on system startup, also with "^Einit gateways"

        ; IP addresses of local prime gateway; if only one, not clear if
        ; its args matter, but provide something plausible.
        PRIME 192 33 33 3, 128 18 1 1

---- SYSTEM:HOSTS.TXT -----
---- Read on system startup, also with "^Einit hosts"

        ; Arbitrarily long, but basically defines local nets and hosts
        ; we need to know about in absence of DNS (CHIVES) info.


---- SYSTEM:HOSTNAME.TXT -----
---- Can't find anything in the monitor that reads this file, but this
---- should be similar to MONNAM.TXT except for containing the FULL domain
---- name of the system.  E.g.:

        BOOTSTRAP.SRI.COM

---- SYSTEM:MONNAM.TXT -----
---- Now *this* definitely is read on system startup.

        BOOTSTRAP


---- SYSTEM:INTERNET-ETHERNET-MAPPINGS.BIN
---- Read on system startup; can also be reloaded by running IPHOST
        with a command (ETHER INIT?)
        This is apparently generated by the IPHOST program using the
        command BUILD, which takes SYSTEM:INTERNET-ETHERNET-MAPPINGS.TXT
        and translates it into .BIN.
        TXT file format *appears* to be:
                HOST xx-xx-xx-xx-xx-xx ddd.ddd.ddd.ddd [/ARP] [/NOARP]
        BIN file format is documented in ANAUNV.MAC.

        Current file is basically empty, contains one zero entry;
        apparently this just makes everything use ARP.


---- SYSTEM:NETSRV.RUN -----
----	File of NETSRV commands, executed by NETSRV.EXE (started by SYSJOB)
	This basically determines what TCP/IP servers will be started.
	Note: NETSRV is not a DEC program; it is one of many non-DEC utilities
	produced by the ARPANET user community, in this case Mark Crispin
	and Kevin Paetzold.


---- SYS:FTSCTT.EXE -----
----	In a vanilla DEC setup this is the FTP server program.  You can
	put the line "RUN SYS:FTSCTT" in <SYSTEM>7-SYSJOB.RUN to start it
	up automatically.  You may also want to set the protection of
	FTPSRT.EXE from 777700 to 777752 to allow general use.


---- System:INTERNET-LOGIN-MESSAGE.TXT -----
----	Contains initial login banner presented to users.  May be a feature
	of the SRI-NIC EXEC only.


General stuff, not network specific:


SYSTEM:7-CONFIG.CMD
	File of commands for SYSTEM:SETSPD.EXE, which is executed by
	monitor at startup (prior to running SYSJOB).

SYSTEM:SYSJOB.RUN
	File of commands for SYSTEM:SYSJOB.EXE, which is also run by
	monitor at startup.
