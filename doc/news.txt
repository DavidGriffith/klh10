KLH10 CHANGES
=============

KLH10 2.0G: 21-May-2002
    - Fixed Large File Support for disks.
    - New XBLT algorithm to fix obscure bug.
    - Unibus warnings now suppressed unless ub_debug is set.
    - NetBSD makefiles fixed.
    - DTE timezone tweaked for DST compensation.
    - Added KLH10_I_CIRC conditional to allow CIRC on non-ITS systems.

KLH10 2.0E: 23-Apr-2002
    - Added workaround for T10/T20 tape boot races (more prevalent
	with ever-faster processors that zip through timing loops).
    - Linux hardware tape support done for now, will be better when
	Linux tape driver (st.c) is fixed.
    - Now uses nanosleep() on systems supporting it.
    - Changed all makefiles that invoke GCC to use -O3 instead of -O.
	This should improve performance slightly, at some risk of
	breakage.

KLH10 2.0D: 28-Mar-2002
    - Several VMTAPE bugs fixed; revised RAW format code.
    - DTE now reports correct local timezone (used by KL TOPS-20).
    - Tape drive serial #s are now uniquized (like disks).
    - Now uses Large File Support on systems that have it; can now
	handle tapes of over 2GB on 32-bit systems.

KLH10 2.0C: 20-Mar-2002
    - Added concurrent command mode.
    - Better Linux hardware tape support; still not complete.

KLH10 2.0A: 19-Nov-2001
    - Revised ARP code in dpimp.c to fix problems with Linux port;
	ITS networking now supported on Linux!
    - Cleaned up Solaris port.  Two Makefiles now provided, one for
	GCC and the other for SUN C.  Compiles and runs, but actual network
	operation not yet verified.  
    - Fixed bug with writing TPS format tape images (caught by John Wilson).
    - Added "port-ks" target to Makefile to help porters.

KLH10 2.0: 10-Nov-2001
      Initial Distribution release.
