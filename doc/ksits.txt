This is mainly a placeholder until distribution issues are resolved
for the starter ITS file system copy.

The run/ksits directory contains the boot files developed for the
Public ITS project, which had 3 systems called PI, DU, DX.  These are
for PI:

	klh10-pi.ini	- KLH10 configuration for PI.

	@.its-647pi-u	- ITS.  Normally you would just load this.
	@.ddt-u		- DDT  stand-alone.
	@.nsalv-260-u	- SALV stand-alone.  Start at 200000 !!
	itsbin.647pi-u	- ITS binary, without DDT or SALV.

	Note: All binaries by default are in U36 format, as opposed
	      to the C36 format of all other KN10 configurations.

Eventually I hope to be able to distribute the actual filesystem image
as well, and then will include a large bunch of stuff containing
nearly everything I've discovered or written about ITS software
porting issues, machine names and addresses, dumps, utilities, bug
fixes, etc.

THE FIRST TIME
==============

Once you have installed the binaries per install.txt in a $KLH10_HOME
corresponding to an instance of run/ksits (don't forget to make
dpimp setuid root, or run as root) it should work to just do:

     ./kn10-ks klh10-kn.ini ;;; or whichever system you prefer)
	       [gubbish]
     KLH10> go

After the dust settles, type ^Z.
The first time, ITS will complain that the time is not known.
Run PDSET.

To correctly set the date in the new millenium, you must use the
undocumented command "C", as in "20C".

PDSET.114
Please don't use this program unless you know how.
You are certain to break something if you happen to hit the wrong key.
Type Control-Z to exit, or ? for a reminder of the commands.
20C				;;; You type "20C"
011110D				;;; You type YYMMDD and D.  YY=01 for 2001.
131012T				;;; Ditto for time, HHMMSS and T.
!.				;;; Finish with "!."

IT IS NOW  1:10:12 PM EST, SATURDAY, NOV 10,2001
IT IS NOW  1:10:14 PM EST, SATURDAY, NOV 10,2001

-------------------------------------------------

From here on, ITS should always know the time.  If it ever gets totally
out of whack, delete the file $KLH10_HOME/APR.TIMEBASE and reboot,
running PDSET again.
