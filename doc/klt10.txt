    [NOTE: Eventually this will describe how to install a TOPS-10 system
    from an installation tape.  For the time being it merely describes
    startup using a ready-made filesystem that I may someday package
    for distribution.  Four monitors are included:

	    704NON.EXE - TOPS-10 V7.04 no network, won't try to load KLNI.
	    704DCN.EXE - TOPS-10 V7.04 with DECnet and LAT
	    704LAT.EXE - TOPS-10 V7.04 with just LAT (untested)
	    SYSTEM.EXE - TOPS-10 V7.04 for the KS.

    You will need to specify an appropriate monitor from this list when
    prompted by BOOT>.]

	In the transcript that follows, all notes are prefaced by
triple semicolons (;;;), and user input is presented in lowercase
where possible -- note that the monitor sometimes echoes typein in
uppercase.  Where there might be some confusion, a note such as "Type
CR" will identify what you need to type.
