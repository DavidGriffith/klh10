The following directories contain programs of uncertain lineage where
the original authors gave no explicit instructions as to the terms of
use or redistribution.

Based on history and e-mail exchanges I believe that "BSD" style
licensing terms are probably what was intended, but could be wrong.

	supdup/   (Unix C version of ITS SUPDUP)
	read20/   (Unix utility to read TOPS-20 DUMPER tape images)
	backwr/   (Unix utility to create TOPS-10 BACKUP tape images)
