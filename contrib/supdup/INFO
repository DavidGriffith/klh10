This file contains information on know problems, bugs, and misfeatures of
supdup, as well as any other random pieces of information that need to
be somewhere.

SUPDUPD needs a new /bin/login because the standard login trashes the
environment.  The /bin/login that we use is included.  The only
requirement is that the TERMCAP (and TERMINFO if you're using it) gets
passed through as well as the TERM environment variable.

The server should do the same optimization with character insert and
delete that it does with line insert and delete.

I probably should make use of scroll regions.  But this is a pain.

If TTYLOC is defined, then the SUPDUP location feature uses Romkey's
ttyloc code.  This could easily be replaced by whatever your
particular machine does about tty location, or left out all together
of course.  The user supdup doesn't yet send TTYLOC information.

The banner should tell you to turn off overstrike if necessary.

3600's have this bug where if you position the cursor at the beginning
of the line and do a newline, the first character of the line is erased.
I have programmed around this bug to some extent, but it sometimes
reappears.  They also have a bug that if you type a meta character the
character that gets sent is shifted and if you type meta shift character
it sends a lowercase character.  There is nothing I can do about this.

For some reason talk, amoung a few other things, core dumps when
supduping in from a lisp machine (either a 3600 or a cadr).  I've seen
the same bug a BBN bitgraph.  It seems to be a bug with programs which
use curses and is evoked by large screen sizes.
