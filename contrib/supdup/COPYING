If I'd thought about it at the time I probably would have used the old
MIT copyright, the same that we put on PC/IP and the C Gateway.
From what I hear, not having actually looked into any of this, the BSD
copyright is pretty much the same thing.

Anyway, you're certainly welcome to redistribute the code as far as
I'm concerned.

Oh, I remember now why I didn't put a copyright on it.  It was because
I used the BSD telnet sources as a starting point for the supdup
programs and the BSD code was not free at the time.  Not very much
telnet code survived in the end but it is where I started from.
