		----------------------------

The KLH10 Auxiliary Distribution consists of all the components (both
software and documentation) residing in the "contrib" and "run"
directories of a typical installation of the KLH10 Distribution.

The KLH10 Distribution license does NOT apply to these components.
They are derived from several sources, each of which may have its own
licensing terms.  They are included solely for the convenience of
users, and in order to avoid licensing conflicts have been made
available in the form of a separate "Auxiliary Distribution" package.
They are subject to removal if their inclusion causes any legal
problems.

The Auxiliary Distribution package includes the following specific
components:

[1] PDP-10 software (bootstrap and diagnostic binaries) from Digital
    Equipment Corporation (now Compaq Corporation).  These may be used
    only with a valid Digital license such as the "Home Hobbyist License"
    (see <http://pdp-10.trailing-edge.com/#license>).
    The specific components are identified by various README files in
    the following subdirectories.

	run/dfkfb/  - Digital (KL10) DFKFB timing test diagnostic binary
	run/klnic/  - Digital (KL10 SRI-NIC) bootstrap binaries
	run/klt10/  - Digital (KL10 TOPS-10) bootstrap binaries
	run/klt20/  - Digital (KL10 TOPS-20) bootstrap binaries
	run/kst10/  - Digital (KS10 TOPS-10) bootstrap binaries
	run/kst20/  - Digital (KS10 TOPS-20) bootstrap binaries


[2] PDP-10 software derived from the MIT ITS systems.  These are
    believed to be usable on terms similar to those of the GNU Public
    License.
    The specific components are listed in the file "run/ksits/README".

	run/ksits/  - MIT (KS10 ITS) system binaries


[3] Utility software from other contributors, where terms were not
    specifically stated but are believed to be similar to those of
    the "BSD" style licenses (e.g. FreeBSD, NetBSD).
    More detail is provided in the file "contrib/README" and the
    individual subdirectories.

	contrib/supdup/ - Unix SUPDUP client and server
	contrib/read20/ - Unix DUMPER tape image reader

		----------------------------

To reiterate: If there is any likelihood that your intended use may
violate any of the licensing terms of the separate components, you
should NOT use them.  If any of the original copyright holders object
to this packaging, I will remove the offending components or simply
stop providing the Auxiliary Distribution altogether.
