# This auxiliary file is needed to get around a bug in the NetBSD
# /usr/include files.  <stdio.h> includes <sys/types.h> which includes
# <machine/types.h> which incorrectly exposes a typedef of vaddr_t (normally
# a kernel only type), thus conflicting with KLH10's vaddr_t.
# By including this file ahead of any other source files (see the -include
# in CENVFLAGS) we can nullify the typedef.
# And while we're at it, blast paddr_t for the same reason.
