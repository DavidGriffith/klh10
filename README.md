KLH10 PDP-10 Emulator
=====================

---

"KLH10" is an emulator for the PDP-10 series of machines from Digital 
Equipment Corporation.  The most important thing to know is that this is 
a MACHINE emulator.  It emulates a specific PDP-10 CPU and all necessary 
I/O devices, running a site's existing operating system (monitor) binary 
without change -- which then runs user-mode application programs just as 
if they were on a real PDP-10.  Even floating-point results are 
bit-identical.

KLH10 was created by Kenneth L. Harrenstien.  Its homepage is
